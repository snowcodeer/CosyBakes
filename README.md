# 🍰 Baking Game – Learn & Play Without the Mess! ✨

This project is a **cute and educational baking game** designed to let you **simulate your favourite recipes** without making a mess in the kitchen! It's a fun and interactive way to explore the steps of baking, helping you **learn and memorise recipes** through repetition and hands-on virtual play. 🧁

It’s also a perfect experience for **young children** who may be too small to handle real kitchen tools — they can safely learn how to bake in a **wholesome, imaginative environment**.

All of this, of course, with a **cutesy pixel art cottagecore aesthetic**! 🏡🌸  
Think warm wooden countertops, cozy mixers, and delightful pastel ingredients — ✨all the charm, none of the cleanup!✨

## ⚠️ Just a Demo!

This is a demo and currently includes just a **half-baked (pardon the pun!) brownie recipe**. 🍫  
More recipes, features, and polish are coming soon!

## 🌐 Future Plans

I'm working on connecting the game to an **API** that will let you **turn *any* of your favorite recipes into a playable game — instantly!**  
Just drop in a recipe link or upload your own, and watch it become an adorable, interactive baking adventure. ✨🍪
